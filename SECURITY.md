# Security policy

Ferrum treats access to a Linux Docker-compatible Unix socket as privileged. Windows/macOS engine integration is outside the current scope. The application must not elevate privileges, relax socket permissions, store plaintext credentials, or send remote engine traffic without explicit secure transport and identity validation. The experimental embedded terminal is limited to the selected local socket; terminal output is untrusted, OSC 52 clipboard and title requests are ignored, user clipboard actions are explicit, and terminal contents must not be logged.

## Reporting a vulnerability

Please use the private vulnerability-reporting feature for this repository in GitHub Security Advisories when it is available. If that feature is unavailable, contact the repository owner through GitHub before sharing details publicly. Do not include credentials, private keys, or production endpoint secrets in public issues.

## Current scope

The Linux application provides container inventory, inspection, bounded historical/live logs, state-gated lifecycle actions, image listing, inspection, anonymous public pulls, tagging, confirmed image removal, and an experimental embedded exec terminal over the selected local Docker-compatible Unix socket. Container Remove requires explicit confirmation and does not force-remove containers or remove volumes. Every image-tag request requires explicit confirmation because Docker Engine v1.56 may reassign an existing `repository:tag`; the image data remains. Image removal confirmation snapshots the selected image ID and known tags, warns that removal of the final reference may delete image data, and explains that the non-force request may be rejected for images used by containers or with other tags. The request sets `noprune=true` to preserve untagged parent images, omits `force`, and does not send registry credentials or authentication. A bounded 30-second removal timeout does not prove that engine state remained unchanged; invalidating the page ignores stale results without aborting or claiming to undo a submitted request. Only one image mutation is allowed at a time. Image pull, tag, and removal operate only through the selected local Linux Docker Unix socket; remote engine connections, credentials, Compose, archive handling, managed engines, and release updates are not implemented. The terminal does not launch an external terminal; closing its exec session does not stop or remove the container. Issue #10 remains open for Podman/rootless and remote compatibility. Image removal has fake-socket and headless UI coverage only; tests do not delete a real image or mutate image resources. See [`docs/security/threat-model.md`](docs/security/threat-model.md) for current risks and controls.
Hiding image-pull progress or invalidating the Images page/context does not abort
an active pull reader: Ferrum drains the response and keeps the mutation gate
closed until a terminal event. Closing Ferrum does not guarantee that the
daemon-side pull stops.

The Volumes page is read-only and limited to listing and inspecting volumes on
the selected local Docker Unix socket on Linux. It displays only name, driver,
scope, creation time, and a plain-text mountpoint; it does not expose labels,
options, status, or usage estimates. No volume mutation, network operations,
Podman/rootless, or remote endpoint support is provided. Issue #17 remains open.
